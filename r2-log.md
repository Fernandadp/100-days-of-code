# 100 Days Of Code - Log

After failing last year in completing 100 Days of Code (only got to day 29), I want to give myself a second chance!
There are some courses/projects that I would like to finish in this time:
- **FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site** (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXJOvkVYQqA&t=7240s) **âˆš**
- FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Weather App with RESTful APIs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdBvSlVCOXw&t=1s)
- FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: E-commerce Site (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPQ1-33teR4&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkArDMazoARtNz1aMwNWmvC&index=3&t=0s)
- PluralSight JavaScript Courses

Those are some ideas. Of course I have tons of other ideas/half done projects/courses/tutorials that I would like to finish, but this is more than enough to start.

### Day 1: April 01, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Resume FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site. Created some new components, adn retrieve rooms info.

**Thoughts:** Never leave an unfinished tutorial so long again!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Fernandadp/hotel-reservation-site-react

### Day 2: April 02, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Continue FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site. Created a Room component, and set a fallback image, in case one of the pictures is missing or broken.

**Thoughts:** I cannot completely explain what I've done today. It is always so easy when someone is explaining it.... let's see when is moment to apply it.

### Day 3: April 03, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:**  Continue FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site. Installed styled components, update SingleRoom and context.

**Thoughts:** mmm I dont know if I really understand what I'm doing :(

### Day 4: April 04, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Resumed Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight. Today I finished the section of Creational Design Patterns. Specifically the Module Pattern, Factory Pattern and Singleton Pattern.

**Thoughts:** I think this patterns are very useful for big applications. I remember having seen some on my last jobs. Now I am more clear about how and when to use them.

### Day 5: April 05, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight. I started with the Structural Design Patterns. Learned about the decorator and facade patterns, how they work and the difference between them. The decorator pattern protects the original object and can add new functionality, but without altering the original object. The facade pattern, just wraps up everything, providing a better interface to interact with the object, but without changing its functionality.

**Thoughts:** Glad to understand this better now. I read a book about patterns last year, but this videos are much easier to follow.

### Day 6: April 06, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight I finished the structural design patterns, and began with the behavioural patterns. Learned about Flyweight pattern, that saves memory by sharing data when dealing with very large objects (and is better to use it only in those cases, with very large mounts of data). The observer pattern, the is one object that is a subject and a (list of) observer that wait for changes coming from hat object. The mediator pattern where only one object manages all the communication.

**Thoughts:** Some patterns are much more complicated than others. Some can be used combined.

### Day 7: April 07, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight, I finished the course! The last pattern was the command pattern, it's like an interface that calls methods as needed. Also today I finished the Figma 'tutorial' (not really a tutorial, but a video where we designed a website) that I started yesterday. I meassured my Js iq again on Pluralsight and is 176 (I don't remember what it was before)

**Thoughts:**  I really liked prototyping with Figma! I think tomorrow I will translate it to html/css to give it life :) and probably will start prototyping other old projects where I got stuck, because my design skills suck, but now I can really visualize what I want to build before starting coding and getting messed up. Also I will start another Js course on Pluralsight. And somehow I need to finish the Hotel Reservation site...

### Day 8: April 08, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** I started building the website I designed in Figma (from that youtube video 'tutorial'). So far only the landing page is almost done, the bubbles are missing and I still don't know if I will try to do them with css or just use images. Ah! and is not yet repsonsive. I am using flexbox, should I use grid instead?

**Thoughts:** I always think html and css are easy peasy, then I start doing some website and start suffering with css, some things won't change...

### Day 9: April 09, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I finished styling the website for desktop views. 

**Thoughts:** I am pretty happy with the results, although it is not exactly perfectly as the prototype. Tomorrow I will fix one detail in the footer and make it responsive. Then I will have to add some JavaScript to show and hide the divs.

### Day 10: April 10, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:** added the circles, but there is a problem at the botten, it pushed the rest of the elements up.... and also had started with the javascript, but didnt finish.

**Thoughts:** I'm tired today, I wanted to finish making the site responsive, but didnt even started  got distracted with js and then with the circles.

### Day 11: April 11, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** So, some progress with the styling, almost responsive, except navbar and footer. I have a problem with a pseudo element, don't know how to fix that. And still need to work on the JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** sometimes I feel I wasn't made for this u.u

### Day 12: April 12, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I added a new breakpoint to my stylesheet, not so much progress today though.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I feel I need way more than an hour to have something done. Especially in a day like today where I was doing totally different stuff, I takes me a while to conentrate and get me actually working and producing.

### Day 13: April 13, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** I think I'm almost done with the styling, just need more testing and trying different screen sizes. I added the mobile menu, it's working pretty good. I just need to finish now the redirection with the links.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I feel defeated by CSS, what the hell is that bottom blank space supposed to be? and how the hell do I remove it? T.T

### Day 14: April 14, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Added Js to navigate through the pages. And as always modifying the styling, but there are still bugs.

**Thoughts:** I'll take a break from this, for a couple of days. Sometimes it works, and then when I come back I see the solution more easily.

### Day 15: April 15, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Added my Soundwave page to codepen.io to share the link, and maybe someone want to help me to find out what the problem with that bottom border is. Also I resumed the React tutorial, where we build a Hotel reservation site. Used styled components to style the banner and completed the single room component.

**Thoughts:** I should start taking more notes on this, but maybe with pen and paper, and not only coding besides the video, because when I see the video I understand what we're doing, but then I forget everything >.<

### Day 16: April 16, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Not much progress today. I reviewed some feedback that I got for my CSS, but there are still problems, and continued with the React tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I have decided to re-write the CSS of Soundwave all over again... when I started I didn't know it would grow so big, so it is not the best at the moment, and I think that leads to those bugs.

### Day 17: April 17, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Continue with the React Tutorial, added some new divs to show all rooms available, and another div where the filter will be. Also changed some stuff in context to always set by default the filter to show all rooms. Also started another web design, while I wait for feedback from the last one (2nd).

**Thoughts:** Today the tutorial was fun, I feel I understood more than normally hehe, but also always gets difficult to translate it into words. And I think I'm having fun now with the designing, that was something I always felt I sucked at, but now that I have the posibility to see the design before I code it, it's some much better! before it was always a reason for frustration, because I started building the website and I didn't like how it looked, and got discouranged from continuing. Now I can start only when I'm sure I will like the final product :)

### Day 18: April 18, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Started working on the room filter, adding some functions to do the actual filtering and updating the state.

**Thoughts:** Despite I can't fully concentrate when I'm watching the course, I think I am understanding more and more. As usual, it would be very hard for me to right now replicate the project or do something similar, but at least I'm happy that I'm understanding more when I'm watching.

### Day 19: April 20, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Finish the different filters (guests, price, size, breakfast and pets) on the react tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Today it was more repetitive, so of course, much easier to undertstand. 

### Day 20: April 21, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Today we added Contentful to the project, and we set up some rooms data to then fetch it from there, instead of from our local data.

**Thoughts:** That tool seems easy and powerful! I wanna learn more!

### Day 21: April 22, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Created a function in the context file, to be able to get the data from Contentful. Checked some options in how to list the items retrieved (by date created, by price incresing or decreasing, etc...). Also created some variables to save my tokens and make them private. Connected Netlify with my project in Github. I was about to deploy it, but got an error when I used the new variables...

**Thoughts:** Almost finished! the last part seemed easy. Just had that error that I didnt have time to investigate.

### Day 22: April 23, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I finished the React tutorial about the Hotel Reservation Site! and deployed it to Netlify :) The error I had yesterday was just a wrong file name (I forgot a . ), Before deploying the app, we added ther environment variables to Netlify. And learned that if we add the _redirects_ file we created at the beginning of the project to show our 404 error page, Netlify would just redirect to their default 404 page.

**Thoughts:** It felt great to finally finish and see the app live :) The ending of the project was much easier that the middle, there I got stuck so much, but at the end everything made sense, and the online tools are easy to use. Looking forward to put this into practice.

### Day 23: April 24, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Started to work again on Soundwave page, fixing the css, starting all over. Already having problems with the height T.T I don't know why it overflows so much, when I set the body's height to 100vh, and main to 100%...

**Thoughts:** already confused :/

### Day 24: April 25, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Continue with Soundwave (again). 

**Thoughts:** I dont know what i'm doing wrong! elements always overflow :( they afre either heigher or wider than the body :(
