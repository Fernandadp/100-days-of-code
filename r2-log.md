# 100 Days Of Code - Log

After failing last year in completing 100 Days of Code (only got to day 29), I want to give myself a second chance!
There are some courses/projects that I would like to finish in this time:
- FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXJOvkVYQqA&t=7240s)
- FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Weather App with RESTful APIs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdBvSlVCOXw&t=1s)
- FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: E-commerce Site (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPQ1-33teR4&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkArDMazoARtNz1aMwNWmvC&index=3&t=0s)
- PluralSight JavaScript Courses

Those are some ideas. Of course I have tons of other ideas/half done projects/courses/tutorials that I would like to finish, but this is more than enough to start.

### Day 1: April 01, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Resume FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site. Created some new components, adn retrieve rooms info.

**Thoughts:** Never leave an unfinished tutorial so long again!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Fernandadp/hotel-reservation-site-react

### Day 2: April 02, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Continue FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site. Created a Room component, and set a fallback image, in case one of the pictures is missing or broken.

**Thoughts:** I cannot completely explain what I've done today. It is always so easy when someone is explaining it.... let's see when is moment to apply it.

### Day 3: April 03, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:**  Continue FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site. Installed styled components, update SingleRoom and context.

**Thoughts:** mmm I dont know if I really understand what I'm doing :(

### Day 4: April 04, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Resumed Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight. Today I finished the section of Creational Design Patterns. Specifically the Module Pattern, Factory Pattern and Singleton Pattern.

**Thoughts:** I think this patterns are very useful for big applications. I remember having seen some on my last jobs. Now I am more clear about how and when to use them.

### Day 5: April 05, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight. I started with the Structural Design Patterns. Learned about the decorator and facade patterns, how they work and the difference between them. The decorator pattern protects the original object and can add new functionality, but without altering the original object. The facade pattern, just wraps up everything, providing a better interface to interact with the object, but without changing its functionality.

**Thoughts:** Glad to understand this better now. I read a book about patterns last year, but this videos are much easier to follow.

### Day 6: April 06, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight I finished the structural design patterns, and began with the behavioural patterns. Learned about Flyweight pattern, that saves memory by sharing data when dealing with very large objects (and is better to use it only in those cases, with very large mounts of data). The observer pattern, the is one object that is a subject and a (list of) observer that wait for changes coming from hat object. The mediator pattern where only one object manages all the communication.

**Thoughts:** Some patterns are much more complicated than others. Some can be used combined.

### Day 7: April 07, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight, I finished the course! The last pattern was the command pattern, it's like an interface that calls methods as needed. Also today I finished the Figma 'tutorial' (not really a tutorial, but a video where we designed a website) that I started yesterday. I meassured my Js iq again on Pluralsight and is 176 (I don't remember what it was before)

**Thoughts:**  I really liked prototyping with Figma! I think tomorrow I will translate it to html/css to give it life :) and probably will start prototyping other old projects where I got stuck, because my design skills suck, but now I can really visualize what I want to build before starting coding and getting messed up. Also I will start another Js course on Pluralsight. And somehow I need to finish the Hotel Reservation site...
