-- edit April 26th--
I added some FreeCodeCamp Certifications that I started long time ago, but haven't finished yet. I would like to finish all those unfinished projects, courses and tutorials that I have scattered on several platforms and on my laptop hehe Instead of just starting and starting new things, I think is also time to start closing some.


### Day 1: April 01, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Resume FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site. Created some new components, adn retrieve rooms info.

**Thoughts:** Never leave an unfinished tutorial so long again!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Fernandadp/hotel-reservation-site-react

### Day 2: April 02, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Continue FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site. Created a Room component, and set a fallback image, in case one of the pictures is missing or broken.

**Thoughts:** I cannot completely explain what I've done today. It is always so easy when someone is explaining it.... let's see when is moment to apply it.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Fernandadp/hotel-reservation-site-react

### Day 3: April 03, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:**  Continue FreeCodeCamp React Tutorial: Hotel Reservation Site. Installed styled components, update SingleRoom and context.

**Thoughts:** mmm I dont know if I really understand what I'm doing :(

### Day 4: April 04, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Resumed Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight. Today I finished the section of Creational Design Patterns. Specifically the Module Pattern, Factory Pattern and Singleton Pattern.

**Thoughts:** I think this patterns are very useful for big applications. I remember having seen some on my last jobs. Now I am more clear about how and when to use them.

### Day 5: April 05, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight. I started with the Structural Design Patterns. Learned about the decorator and facade patterns, how they work and the difference between them. The decorator pattern protects the original object and can add new functionality, but without altering the original object. The facade pattern, just wraps up everything, providing a better interface to interact with the object, but without changing its functionality.

**Thoughts:** Glad to understand this better now. I read a book about patterns last year, but this videos are much easier to follow.

### Day 6: April 06, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight I finished the structural design patterns, and began with the behavioural patterns. Learned about Flyweight pattern, that saves memory by sharing data when dealing with very large objects (and is better to use it only in those cases, with very large mounts of data). The observer pattern, the is one object that is a subject and a (list of) observer that wait for changes coming from hat object. The mediator pattern where only one object manages all the communication.

**Thoughts:** Some patterns are much more complicated than others. Some can be used combined.

### Day 7: April 07, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript on Pluralsight, I finished the course! The last pattern was the command pattern, it's like an interface that calls methods as needed. Also today I finished the Figma 'tutorial' (not really a tutorial, but a video where we designed a website) that I started yesterday. I meassured my Js iq again on Pluralsight and is 176 (I don't remember what it was before)

**Thoughts:**  I really liked prototyping with Figma! I think tomorrow I will translate it to html/css to give it life :) and probably will start prototyping other old projects where I got stuck, because my design skills suck, but now I can really visualize what I want to build before starting coding and getting messed up. Also I will start another Js course on Pluralsight. And somehow I need to finish the Hotel Reservation site...

### Day 8: April 08, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** I started building the website I designed in Figma (from that youtube video 'tutorial'). So far only the landing page is almost done, the bubbles are missing and I still don't know if I will try to do them with css or just use images. Ah! and is not yet repsonsive. I am using flexbox, should I use grid instead?

**Thoughts:** I always think html and css are easy peasy, then I start doing some website and start suffering with css, some things won't change...

### Day 9: April 09, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I finished styling the website for desktop views. 

**Thoughts:** I am pretty happy with the results, although it is not exactly perfectly as the prototype. Tomorrow I will fix one detail in the footer and make it responsive. Then I will have to add some JavaScript to show and hide the divs.

### Day 10: April 10, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:** added the circles, but there is a problem at the botten, it pushed the rest of the elements up.... and also had started with the javascript, but didnt finish.

**Thoughts:** I'm tired today, I wanted to finish making the site responsive, but didnt even started  got distracted with js and then with the circles.

### Day 11: April 11, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** So, some progress with the styling, almost responsive, except navbar and footer. I have a problem with a pseudo element, don't know how to fix that. And still need to work on the JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** sometimes I feel I wasn't made for this u.u

### Day 12: April 12, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I added a new breakpoint to my stylesheet, not so much progress today though.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I feel I need way more than an hour to have something done. Especially in a day like today where I was doing totally different stuff, I takes me a while to conentrate and get me actually working and producing.

### Day 13: April 13, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** I think I'm almost done with the styling, just need more testing and trying different screen sizes. I added the mobile menu, it's working pretty good. I just need to finish now the redirection with the links.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I feel defeated by CSS, what the hell is that bottom blank space supposed to be? and how the hell do I remove it? T.T

### Day 14: April 14, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Added Js to navigate through the pages. And as always modifying the styling, but there are still bugs.

**Thoughts:** I'll take a break from this, for a couple of days. Sometimes it works, and then when I come back I see the solution more easily.

### Day 15: April 15, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Added my Soundwave page to codepen.io to share the link, and maybe someone want to help me to find out what the problem with that bottom border is. Also I resumed the React tutorial, where we build a Hotel reservation site. Used styled components to style the banner and completed the single room component.

**Thoughts:** I should start taking more notes on this, but maybe with pen and paper, and not only coding besides the video, because when I see the video I understand what we're doing, but then I forget everything >.<

### Day 16: April 16, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Not much progress today. I reviewed some feedback that I got for my CSS, but there are still problems, and continued with the React tutorial. https://codepen.io/Fernandadp/pen/PoPZjYw

**Thoughts:** I have decided to re-write the CSS of Soundwave all over again... when I started I didn't know it would grow so big, so it is not the best at the moment, and I think that leads to those bugs.

### Day 17: April 17, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Continue with the React Tutorial, added some new divs to show all rooms available, and another div where the filter will be. Also changed some stuff in context to always set by default the filter to show all rooms. Also started another web design, while I wait for feedback from the last one (2nd).

**Thoughts:** Today the tutorial was fun, I feel I understood more than normally hehe, but also always gets difficult to translate it into words. And I think I'm having fun now with the designing, that was something I always felt I sucked at, but now that I have the posibility to see the design before I code it, it's some much better! before it was always a reason for frustration, because I started building the website and I didn't like how it looked, and got discouranged from continuing. Now I can start only when I'm sure I will like the final product :)

### Day 18: April 18, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Started working on the room filter, adding some functions to do the actual filtering and updating the state.

**Thoughts:** Despite I can't fully concentrate when I'm watching the course, I think I am understanding more and more. As usual, it would be very hard for me to right now replicate the project or do something similar, but at least I'm happy that I'm understanding more when I'm watching.

### Day 19: April 20, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Finish the different filters (guests, price, size, breakfast and pets) on the react tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Today it was more repetitive, so of course, much easier to undertstand. 

### Day 20: April 21, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Today we added Contentful to the project, and we set up some rooms data to then fetch it from there, instead of from our local data.

**Thoughts:** That tool seems easy and powerful! I wanna learn more!

### Day 21: April 22, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Created a function in the context file, to be able to get the data from Contentful. Checked some options in how to list the items retrieved (by date created, by price incresing or decreasing, etc...). Also created some variables to save my tokens and make them private. Connected Netlify with my project in Github. I was about to deploy it, but got an error when I used the new variables...

**Thoughts:** Almost finished! the last part seemed easy. Just had that error that I didnt have time to investigate.

### Day 22: April 23, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I finished the React tutorial about the Hotel Reservation Site! and deployed it to Netlify :) The error I had yesterday was just a wrong file name (I forgot a . ), Before deploying the app, we added ther environment variables to Netlify. And learned that if we add the _redirects_ file we created at the beginning of the project to show our 404 error page, Netlify would just redirect to their default 404 page. https://hotel-reservation-site-in-reactjs.netlify.app/

**Thoughts:** It felt great to finally finish and see the app live :) The ending of the project was much easier that the middle, there I got stuck so much, but at the end everything made sense, and the online tools are easy to use. Looking forward to put this into practice.

### Day 23: April 24, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Started to work again on Soundwave page, fixing the css, starting all over. Already having problems with the height T.T I don't know why it overflows so much, when I set the body's height to 100vh, and main to 100%...

**Thoughts:** already confused :/

### Day 24: April 25, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Continue with Soundwave (again). 

**Thoughts:** I dont know what i'm doing wrong! elements always overflow :( they afre either heigher or wider than the body :(

### Day 25: April 26, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I resumed my FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Today I worked on the React section. I learned about the React Lifecycle Methods. Some of the most important are: _componentDidMount()_, _shouldComponentUpdate()_, _componentDidUpdate()_, _componentWillUnmount()_. One good practice in React is to place API calls or any call to the server in _componentDidMount()_ it will automatically trigger an update once the data is recieved (if setState is also here), also here is the best place to attach an event listener. Another good practice is to clean up React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action. _shouldComponentUpdate()_ is used when children of a component receive new props or state. This checks if "nextProps" or "nextState" are equal to the current, if so, then it doesn't re renders the component. The check needs to be a boolean. The styling in JSX is similar to normal html, except that the style cannot be a string, instead we set it equal to a js object. (style={{ style rules }}). React doesn't accept kebab case keys (like font-size), instead they have to be camel case (fontSize). As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX. Length property values are assumed to be in "px", unless otherwise specified. All property values should be wrapped in quotes (except length values in px, then we can write only the number). To keep the code better organised we can declare a _styles_ object and set out style rules there, and the use use it inside our render method where we need it.

**Thoughts:** I'm so frustrated with the css of Soundwave, that I decided to continue with this curriculum. Also I updated my goals for this challenge, added some courses that I want to watch, and some other unfinished stuff that I have lying around.

### Day 26: April 27, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Continue with FreeCodeCamp React section of the Front End Libraries certification. In JSX instead of using if/else to render something based on a condition, I can use &&, for example, **{condition && markup}**. I can have multiple conditions together with &&. It is also possible to use ternary operators for dynamic rendering, they can be inserted directly into the JSX code, whereas if/else statement not (they must go outside the return).

**Thoughts:** a bit slow today.

### Day 27: April 28, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I finished a couple of exercises of the JavaScript Basic section, that were added after I had completed that section few months ago. They were about recurssion, which is very complicated to me! It was a small hint about what Recurssion is, but not enough to feel confident about it. At least is a help to later solve the certification projects or some of the algorithm problems that I still haven't finished. Also I completed the React section, it was nice to see hoy much I have progressed. 

**Thoughts:** It is nice to see some React split in small portions and see that it is not complicated after all. 

### Day 28: April 29, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** I started with the Redux section of FreeCodeCamp. Redux is a predictable state container, it is a state management framework. Here, there is a **single state object** that's responsible for the entire state of the app. This state object is housed in the **Redux store**, which is the single piece of thruth when it comes to the app state. If any piece of the app wants to update state, it MUST do it through the React store. All the state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. An **action** is a JavaScript object that contains information about an event that has ocurred. Data is optional, but actions must carry a type property that specifies the type of action that has occurred. **Reducers** are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A reducer takes a state and an action as arguments, it always returns a new state, this is the **only** role of the reducer. In Redux, state is read only, so reducers must always return a new copy of state and NEVER modify it directly. 
 
**Thoughts:** Wow, Redux has always been hard for me, it is always so complex and abstract, because the times I've worked with it, it was always in big applications, but it is nice to see it from the start here and piece by piece.

### Day 29: April 30, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Redux section of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I learned that using JavaScript switch is a standard pattern in writting Redux reducers. Don't forget _default_ case, which returns the current state. Register a store listener: **store.subscribe()** allows to subscribe listener functions to the store, which are called whenever an action is dispatched against the store. Use the spread operator to help enforce state immutability.

**Thoughts:** Wow, it wasn't so tough, although of course I would need to repeat this maybe, but the examples are simple and basic, and it makes it much easier to understand what Reudx really does. And today is my day 29th! so at least I did as well as last year, but I want to finish the 100 days this time!

### Day 30: May 01, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Started with React and Redux section of FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** omg, I need so much more practice. I had to review and research a lot, and we did only things that we had done in the previous sections. And today I already did better than last time in the challenge :)

### Day 31: May 02, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** I finished the React and Redux section of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and started with the Front end projects.

**Thoughts:** The second part of the React and Redux section was much easier than the first! I didn't have troubles finishing it.

### Day 32: May 03, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Continue working on the Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts:** I suck at JavaScript >.<

### Day 33: May 04, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Random Quote Machine! the first project of the Front End Libraries Projects Certification of FreeCodeCamp. https://codepen.io/Fernandadp/pen/BaomNYv

**Thoughts:** OMG, unbelievable how much I can still suffer with some simple vanilla js, I've been so caught up trying to learn React or solving algorithms, that when I have to do some simple rendering I get all confused. As usual, I am not proud of the design of the project, but whatever. --Editing this 5 minutes later-- I just realized that the whole point of these projects is to use the libraries learned! I am so dumb! I always want to practice my vanilla js, but actually this was just not the time to do it. Tomorrow I will re do it in React.

### Day 34: May 05, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I started the project from yesterday in React. 

**Thoughts:** I had troubles making React work on Codepen, now it's all good, but I still have problems with that async call, and not being always able to use the data.

### Day 35: May 06, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** No progress :( tried to use the data, but have problems with the delay...

**Thoughts:** Gosh, this should be easy peasy... it's the basic of the basic...

### Day 36: May 07, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I managed to work with the data and display it! Now I need to generate new quotes when clicking the button and fix the css a bit.

**Thoughts:** Ok! happy with the progress :) it is not all finished, but I thought I wouldn't be able to do much, especially because I didn't have so much time today, I thoght I would need way longer.

### Day 37: May 08, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:** I fininished the Random Quote Machine with Reactjs this time :) today I created a new method to generate a new random number, that will change the parameters that I have saved in the state, and that retrieve new quotes from the data from the api. https://codepen.io/Fernandadp/pen/ZEbvqyN

**Thoughts:** I am quite happy to be honest. Two days ago I thought it would take me very long to figure this out.

### Day 38: May 09, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** I started the next project of the FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification. It is a Mardown Previewer, I am building it with React, so far I've added the skeleton and I am reviewing the React section again, especially the controlled input task.

**Thoughts:** It doesn't seem too difficult, I think it is similar to that task I wrote above, but today I am a bit tired and sleepy, so no more progress.

### Day 39: May 10, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Not much progress today either. At least the library (marked js) is working now, I can see my formated text, but there are still some issues, some line breaks not working.

**Thoughts:** I had to research how to import the library, wasn't working, then I found a post in FreeCodeCamp and there is one React methid I had to use, slow progress, but progressing.  

### Day 40: May 11, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Markdown Previewer! Although as always, design sucks, but it works.

**Thoughts:** I finished it, but I think I could put more effort in it, and make it prettier, but can be bothered right now hehe, it works, that's what matters to me.

### Day 41: May 12, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I started the Drum Machine project from FreeCodeCamp. I started building the component in React, set up the basics and search from the audio files that I need. 

**Thoughts:** It was hard to find some free online files to use, it took me a while, but I really like the project!

### Day 42: May 13, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** I refactored my code like two times, trying different approaches to the problem. But so far, I haven't found the solution yet. I also added some style.

**Thoughts:** I think it might be an easy answer, maybe mapping... but I am also not sure if the way I am storing the urls is the correct.

### Day 43: May 14, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I managed to create a method to play the audio when clicking the button and another one to play the audio when pressing down the corresponding key on the keyboard. I have some repetition on my code that I would like to remove, so I guess tomorrow I will create a new reusable method to avoid repeating.

**Thoughts:** This has been more difficult than I expectedm, but it's fun! I think no other project before kept me so entertained. 

### Day 44: May 15, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Drum Machine from FreeCodeCamp, I thought I had more left to do, but nope, it was only displaying the sound that was being played. I continue with the algorithm scripting, solved one and I am stuck in another one. 

**Thoughts:** I need to learn recursion! I still can't understand it properly.
