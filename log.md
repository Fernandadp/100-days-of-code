# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 26, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** setting up everything to start coding tomorrow!

### Day 1: May 27, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Found my old FreeCodeCamp projects, and continue working towards the Responsive Web Design Certification. Currently I'm working on the Technical Documentation Page.

**Thoughts:** I really need to learn some design skills.

### Day 2: May 28, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Technical Documentation Page of FreeCodeCamp's Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** Apart from design skills, I should definitely spend some time learning more css. I thought I was quite comfortable with it, but today I struggle with some little things, like avoiding two divs to overlap. So far I am not so happy with the result tbh.

### Day 3: May 29, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** I have started the Portfolio Page of FreeCodeCamp. I have added all html elements, I only need to add some content. Also I have started adding some styling, so far I have done the header and a bit of nav bar.

**Thoughts:** I enjoy doing this so much! Style is always an issue, but I think with practice and observation (meaning looking at other websites) I can improve it. Also I like photography a lot, I should definitely pick it up again.

### Day 4: May 30, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I continued working on the Portfolio Page, I am almost done, only few details to make all the tests pass. 
So, i came back for a second round today and finally got my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification! (https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fernandadp/responsive-web-design)

**Thoughts:** Although I am almost done, I've done actually almost enough to fullfill the requirements for making the test pass. Designwise of course it looks horrible, and there are details like margins and stuff that should definitely be improved.


### Day 5: May 31, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Continue with FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification.

**Thoughts:** Didn't have time to start with some React project, so I will continue with this for now. I didnt remember that I had already done some of this.


### Day 6: June 1, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Continue the Front End Libraries Certification of FreeCodeCamp. Finished the jQuery section. Learned about some jQuery functions, function chaining (sticking two jQuery functions together). Started the React section (Sass I had already done it some months ago). To use JS inside JSX, simply include the code that is wanted to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: { 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }. Babbel is used to transpile jsx into js. Nested JSX must always return a single element (This one parent element would wrap all of the other levels of nested elements). Comments in jsx: {/* */}.The naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase (for example onclick is onClick in jsx). `<hr>` defines a thematic break.

**Thoughts:** Finally started with React. I had forgotten how helpful and easy jQuery is.
 
### Day 7: June 2, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Continue working on the React section of FCC. When rendering to the ReactDOM: `ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));`. To render: first call `Render(){}` method, and then return inside it the jsx. Learned how to pass props (properties) to the components.  
 
**Thoughts:** I should be a lot more confident and skillful using React, especially after de last 2 months where my job was mainly working with React components, but here I am, still struggling a bit, but now is making a lot more sense.

### Day 8: June 3, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Continue with React from FCC. Passing default props, I can pass a default prop just in case no value is expliciti provided, but if I pass `null` it will remain `null`. Defining `propTypes`, so it will throw an error if the type is different to what I'm expecting. A _stateless functional component_ is any function which accepts props and returns JSX, no need of `render()` method before the `return`. A _stateless component_, on the other hand, is a class that `extends React.Component`, but does not use internal state. A _stateful component_ is any component that does maintain its own internal state (normally referred to simply as components or React components). `State` consists of any data the application needs to know about, that can change over time. 

**Thoughts:** Understanding more this that i've already used before, but I think I will really understand this whe I have to work in a project from scratch.

### Day 9: June 4, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Continue the Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms Certification of FreeCodeCamp. I finished the (already started months ago) Basic JavaScript section, and started with ES6.

**Thoughts:** I always think I still have so much more to learn, but today I think that I also have learnt so much in the last year.

### Day 10: June 5, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Continue the Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms Certification of FreeCodeCamp, ES6. Learnt about the **Rest Operator** `...`, it is useful because I can create functions that take a **variable number of arguments**. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function. Also the **Spread Operator**, `...`, allows us to expand the elements of an array (or get the elements out of the array ). Something similar can be made with objects, it is called _destructuring_ an object. If I have an object: `voxel = {x: 3.6, y: 7.4, z: 6.54 };` I can use the spread operator like this: `const { x, y, z } = voxel;`, but I I want to change the key names, I have to do it like this: `const { x : a, y : b, z : c } = voxel` ("get the field x and copy the value into a..."). One **key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring** is that the spread operator unpacks **all** contents of an array into a comma-separated list. Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables. Desctructuring an array: `const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];` a get assigned the first value of the array and b the second. It is also possible to access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index: `const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];` (logs [1, 2, 5]). Destructuring can also be used to choose the fields of an object that I want to work with, instead of having to work with the whole object. Template literals, ` `` ` and string interpolation `${variable(s)}`. The `class` key word, which it is used to create constructor objects/functions. **Getters** and **Setters**, the first are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object's private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable. The Setters are meant to modify (set) the value of an object's private variable based on the value passed into the setter function. Difference between **require()** and **import**, require() allows me to bring functions and code from one file to another, but with import I can choose _which_ functions or code I want to bring. **Export**, when is a default export, I can only have one value to be default and it cannot be used with `var`, `let`, or `cons`. When I am importing a default value, it is not necessary to use `{}`. Finished **ES6** section!

**Thoughts:**  ES6 makes so many things so much easier! also it is used in React, so it is very important to learn it well.
