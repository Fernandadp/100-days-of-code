# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 26, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** setting up everything to start coding tomorrow!

### Day 1: May 27, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Found my old FreeCodeCamp projects, and continue working towards the Responsive Web Design Certification. Currently I'm working on the Technical Documentation Page.

**Thoughts:** I really need to learn some design skills.

### Day 2: May 28, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Technical Documentation Page of FreeCodeCamp's Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** Apart from design skills, I should definitely spend some time learning more css. I thought I was quite comfortable with it, but today I struggle with some little things, like avoiding two divs to overlap. So far I am not so happy with the result tbh.

### Day 3: May 29, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** I have started the Portfolio Page of FreeCodeCamp. I have added all html elements, I only need to add some content. Also I have started adding some styling, so far I have done the header and a bit of nav bar.

**Thoughts:** I enjoy doing this so much! Style is always an issue, but I think with practice and observation (meaning looking at other websites) I can improve it. Also I like photography a lot, I should definitely pick it up again.

### Day 4: May 30, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I continued working on the Portfolio Page, I am almost done, only few details to make all the tests pass. 
So, i came back for a second round today and finally got my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification! (https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fernandadp/responsive-web-design)
**Thoughts:** Although I am almost done, I've done actually almost enough to fullfill the requirements for making the test pass. Designwise of course it looks horrible, and there are details like margins and stuff that should definitely be improved.


### Day 5: May 31, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Continue with FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification.

**Thoughts:** Didn't have time to start with some React project, so I will continue with this for now. I didnt remember that I had already done some of this.


### Day 6: June 1, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Continue the Front End Libraries Certification of FreeCodeCamp. Finished the jQuery section. Learned about some jQuery functions, function chaining (sticking two jQuery functions together).
